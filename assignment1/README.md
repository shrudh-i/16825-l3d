# Instructions for Running Homework-1:
All deliverables required for Homework-1 can be obtained by running:

```
python main.py
```
All output files will be generated into the _submission_ directory, please ensure not to modify or remove it.

# Important Notes on Implementation:
* The source code for each section is completed through the files in the _src_ directory. They are built off of the starter files provided in the _starter_ directory of the assignment
* Files from the _src_ directory are imported within _main.py_ to execute each subsection required for the assignment
* The implementation for Section 5.1 is done directly within _main.py_ and is not present within a code file in _src_

# Note on Runtime:
Running the entire _main.py_ file takes approximately 36 seconds, 1 minute at max, using a GPU. The ```device = get_device()``` has been maintained for all implementations.
