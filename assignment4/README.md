# Instructions for Running Homework-3:
All deliverables required for Homework-4 can be obtained by running:

```
python main.py
```
All output files will be generated into the *images* directory, please ensure not to modify or remove it.

# Important Notes on Implementation:
* All training done for this assignment were performed using AWS and Q2.3 was done using a friend's system laptop
* The `main.py` file contains all the terminal calls required to run all sections for Assignment-4. But, ensure that you should change the text prompts before running them to get the desired output as shown on the website
* Please make note that I have added a "save checkpoints" feature in question Q.1.2.2, I found that to be very useful in case my system shutdown or there were any issues
* In addition to that, I added a "num_itrs" argument for some of the questions that were lacking them
* Please note the comments where I have mentioned "#NOTE this is my addition to the implementation", those are things that I have added for ease of use of the code
