Interpretation of Failure Cases:

Chair misclassification analysis:
  • Misclassified as lamp: 1 instances
  • Analysis of chair misclassifications:
    - 1 chairs misclassified as lamps - likely chairs with unusual shapes or arm structures

Vase misclassification analysis:
  • Misclassified as lamp: 9 instances
  • Misclassified as chair: 1 instances
  • Analysis of vase misclassifications:
    - 1 vases misclassified as chairs - possibly vases with wider bases or unusual shapes
    - 9 vases misclassified as lamps - likely vases with flared openings resembling lampshades

Lamp misclassification analysis:
  • Misclassified as vase: 8 instances
  • Analysis of lamp misclassifications:
    - 8 lamps misclassified as vases - likely floor lamps with straight vertical structures
